        <step>
            <p>Six unique origin stories, each with a story that affects the game as a whole:
            </p>
            <list type="decimal">
                <li>City Elf</li>
                <li>Dalish Elf</li>
                <li>Dwarf Commoner</li>
                <li>Dwarf Noble</li>
                <li>Human Noble</li>
                <li>
                    <anchor name="fav-story"/>
                    Magi
                </li>
            </list>
        </step>
        <step>Three base classes to choose from: rogue, warrior or mage.</step>
        <step>Three playable races: dwarf, human, and elf.</step>
        <step>Party-based gameplay with the player's character, plus up to three other characters chosen from a larger
            pool
            during the game.
        </step>
        <step>Combat is real-time pause-and-play tactical. This means that you select an enemy to begin attacking
            automatically, and at any point can pause the game to select commands.
        </step>
        <step>The camera provides an over-the-shoulder viewpoint when zoomed in, or an isometric-style viewpoint when
            zoomed out, although on the console editions, zooming, and therefore the isometric-style viewpoint, is
            unavailable.
        </step>
        <step>Spell interactions (for example a blizzard spell can put out fires, and fire spells can ignite grease from a grease
            spell).
        </step>
        <step>Depth-of-field effects which can be switched off via the options menu.</step>
    </procedure>

            <def title="A Tale of Orzammar">
                Tapster's Tavern is the one place where all levels of the rigidly stratified Dwarven society can meet. As such, it is an excellent place for deals to be made - often of a somewhat illicit nature. You've heard word that a Dwarven Noble is looking to hire an adventurer for a small foray into the Deep Roads. It should pay well - and, perhaps give you some insight into the politics of Orzammar. Knowledge that can be worth far more than gold...
            </def>
            <def title="Warden's Keep">
                Centuries before the events of Dragon Age: Origins, the Grey Wardens of Ferelden took up arms against their kingdom's rulers. This tumultuous event led to the expulsion of the Grey Wardens from Ferelden, leaving their ancient fortress of Soldier's Peak to the ravages of time. This downloadable content provides the Warden with an opportunity to aid Levi Dryden in redeeming his family name by proving that Sophia Dryden, his great great grandmother and commander of the Grey Wardens at Soldier's Peak, acted honorably.
