        <step>
            <p>Six unique origin stories, each with a story that affects the game as a whole:
            </p>
            <list type="decimal">
                <li>City Elf</li>
                <li>Dalish Elf</li>
                <li>Dwarf Commoner</li>
                <li>Dwarf Noble</li>
                <li>Human Noble</li>
                <li>Magi</li>
            </list>
        </step>
        <step>Three base classes to choose from: rogue, warrior or mage.</step>
        <step>Three playable races: dwarf, human, and elf.</step>
        <step>Party-based gameplay with the player's character, plus up to three other characters chosen from a larger
            pool
            during the game.
        </step>
        <step>Combat is real-time pause-and-play tactical. This means that you select an enemy to begin attacking
            automatically, and at any point can pause the game to select commands.
        </step>
        <step>The camera provides an over-the-shoulder viewpoint when zoomed in, or an isometric-style viewpoint when
            zoomed out, although on the console editions, zooming, and therefore the isometric-style viewpoint, is
            unavailable.
        </step>
        <step>Spell interactions (e.g. a blizzard spell can put out fires, and fire spells can ignite grease from a grease
            spell).
        </step>
        <step>Depth-of-field effects which can be switched off via the options menu.</step>
    </procedure>
